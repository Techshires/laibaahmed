   </h2>
   <p>
  I am 8th semester student of BSCS at Punjab University. I have previously done my Intermediate from Punjab Group of Colleges. I am always into learning new skills and technologies.
  I am very interested in Web Development and Game Development.Apart from my studies, I am a crafter running online crafting business for almost 5 years and delivering my items all across the country. Crafting and painting is always peace of mind for me.

    I also try to do as much welfare work as I can. Every ramadan I try to collect donations and help poor children celebrate their Eid same like we do. 
    Now a days I am learning some new skills and working on my FYP and trying to learn new skills and technologies.
